### Hi there 👋

FullStack developer Junior 🐙 

I'm a junior fullstack web developer with a focus on JavaScript based in France. My journey into tech began with a bootcamp in 2021, where I learned Ruby, as well as the basics of JavaScript. Following that, I completed with web development program in 2022, where I earned my degree and honed my skills in JavaScript.

Even when I'm not enrolled in formal courses, I'm constantly learning and growing as a developer. Prior to transitioning to tech, I had a career in the arts, which gives me a unique perspective and skillset that I bring to my work.
