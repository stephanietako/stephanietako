### Hi there 👋

Am a beginner web developer 🐙 Mainly focused on a javascript environment 

I first started with a BootCamp in ruby and ruby on rails which allowed me to consolidate my desire to become a professional Web developer.
So I decided to do the training at OpenClassrooms to focused on my goal with passion
