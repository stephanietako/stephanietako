### Hi there 👋

Am a beginner web developer 🐙 Mainly focused on a JavaScript environment 

I have notions of ruby and ruby on rails however my interest is particularly focused on JavaScript.
That's why I decided to do the Openclassrooms training in web development in order to focus on my goal with passion.
